  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'All mutating endpoints require auth + double-submit CSRF (X-CSRF header matches sb_csrf cookie); membership/admin checks enforced server-side.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'SQL filters and ordering are pushed to DB (ORDER BY created_at DESC; task_types ORDER BY name ASC).'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Optimistic concurrency enforced via version; conflict codes CONFLICT_VERSION/CONFLICT_CLAIMED used consistently.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Previously missing AC coverage is now asserted in HTTP tests (membership checks, status/type_id filters + invalid values, claimed_by ignored on PATCH, non-claimer forbidden).'
