  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Auth required; org admins allowed; project admins allowed via is_any_project_admin_in_org; unauthorized users get 403.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Single org-scoped query with ORDER BY email; MVP explicitly has no pagination.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Returns 500 on DB errors; returns 200 with empty list for no matches.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'HTTP handler delegates DB work; SQL is parameterized and isolated in sql/*.sql; tests cover main flows.'
