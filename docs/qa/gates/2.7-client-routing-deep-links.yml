  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No auth surface change; URL parsing is simple and not used for dangerous interpolation.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Hydration planner uses Loading/Loaded guards; no performance regressions observed in smoke.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'History API behavior validated: user navigation uses pushState; normalization/redirect uses replaceState (Scenario 2 PASS).'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Router/hydration are well separated and covered by unit tests; browser smoke is documented.'
