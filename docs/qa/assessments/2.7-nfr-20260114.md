# NFR Assessment: 2.7

Date: 2026-01-14
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS - No auth changes; URL parsing is simple and not used for privileged escalation.
- Performance: PASS - Planner avoids redundant fetches; History API updates are local.
- Reliability: CONCERNS - Browser-level behavior (popstate/F5) not covered by automated tests.
- Maintainability: PASS - Routing/hydration extracted to modules; main module still large but improved.

## Critical Issues

None.

## Concerns

1. **Reliability evidence gap**
   - Risk: regressions in popstate handling or canonicalization may only be caught manually.
   - Recommendation: add a minimal integration/E2E test if feasible; otherwise maintain a manual smoke checklist.

## Quick Wins

- Add a smoke test script (or documented steps) to validate:
  - `/admin/members?project=2` returns `index.html` under Caddy.
  - back/forward keeps route and does not refetch in a loop.
