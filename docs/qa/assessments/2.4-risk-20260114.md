## Risk Matrix

| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SEC-001 | Abuse/spam of password reset endpoints (public surface) | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| DATA-001 | Token reuse / multiple active tokens per email | Low (1) | High (3) | 3 | Low |
| OPS-001 | User confusion: link always returned even for unknown email | Medium (2) | Low (1) | 2 | Low |

## Mitigations & Evidence

- **SEC-001**: Added IP-based rate limiting on request/validate/consume handlers.
- **DATA-001**: DB enforces single active token per email (partial unique index); tokens are marked used; previous tokens invalidated on regenerate.
- **OPS-001**: MVP constraint (“no SMTP”); UI communicates copy/paste flow.
