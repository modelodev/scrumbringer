# NFR Assessment: 2.5

Date: 2026-01-14
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary

- Security: PASS - No new server surface; persistence is client-only. Theme CSS is constant and token-driven.
- Performance: PASS - Theme switching is local (CSS vars) with minimal runtime cost.
- Reliability: PASS - Invalid/unknown persisted value falls back to `default` without breaking UI.
- Maintainability: CONCERNS - Global CSS-in-string is acceptable for MVP but needs discipline to avoid drift (hard-coded colors returning) and to keep tokens minimal.
