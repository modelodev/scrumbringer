## Risk Matrix

| Risk ID  | Description                                        | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| TECH-001 | Routing/hydration loop or duplicated network calls  | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| UX-001   | Back/forward or refresh breaks deep-link context    | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| OPS-001  | SPA fallback/proxy misconfig causes 404s on refresh | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |
| MNT-001  | Large client module raises maintenance risk         | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |

## Mitigations & Test Focus

### TECH-001 (Medium)
- Mitigation: hydration planner is idempotent via Loading/Loaded checks; routing uses NavigateTo + UrlChanged with equality guard.
- Test focus: unit tests for router and hydration plan (exists). Recommended: add integration/E2E for actual browser navigation.

### UX-001 (Medium)
- Mitigation: popstate subscription triggers UrlChanged; URL is re-parsed and hydration re-run.
- Test focus: manual verification checklist for back/forward + F5; recommended automation if tooling exists.

### OPS-001 (Low)
- Mitigation: provide trackable `Caddyfile.example` and startup script for `SB_PORT`.
- Test focus: smoke test: `caddy run` + `curl -I` to deep link returns index.html.

### MNT-001 (Low)
- Mitigation: logic moved into dedicated modules (`router`, `hydration`, `member_section`), keeping main module orchestration-only.

## Monitoring / Follow-up

- Add a lightweight manual QA checklist to validate AC1/2/4/5 on at least one modern browser.
- If E2E tooling exists, add a single deep-link navigation test to reduce regression risk.
