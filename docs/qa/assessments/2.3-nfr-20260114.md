# NFR Assessment: 2.3

Date: 2026-01-14
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary

- Security: PASS - Role update endpoint is org-admin only and requires CSRF; negative paths return `403`.
- Performance: PASS - Simple DB operations; user list is org-scoped and small for MVP.
- Reliability: PASS - Role update done transactionally and guardrail prevents admin lockout.
- Maintainability: PASS - Clear separation (HTTP handler → DB service); tests added for key constraints.
