Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 3
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 0
- Medium Risks: 1
- Low Risks: 2
- Story Risk Score: 96/100

## Risk Matrix

| Risk ID  | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-------------|--------|-------|----------|
| PERF-001 | Client runs 1s timer tick continuously (even when no active task) | Medium (2) | Low (1) | 2 | Low |
| DATA-001 | “Now Working” state can become stale if tasks deleted/out of sync | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| REQ-001  | Timer uses client clock; may diverge from server `as_of` semantics | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |

## Mitigations / Recommendations

1. **REQ-001 (Medium)**
   - Use server `as_of` to compute baseline elapsed time, then tick forward from that baseline.
   - Add a small unit test around timer baseline computation if feasible.

2. **PERF-001 (Low)**
   - Only schedule `NowWorkingTicked` when `active_task` exists (and/or only on Member page).

3. **DATA-001 (Low)**
   - Consider defensive handling for missing task titles (already falls back to `Task #{id}`); keep this behavior.
