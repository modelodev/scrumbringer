# NFR Assessment: 2.4

Date: 2026-01-14
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary

- Security: CONCERNS - Public reset endpoints lack rate limiting; validation returns 200 vs 403 which can be used for account enumeration when combined with request.
- Performance: PASS - Simple, indexed lookups and small transactional updates; fine for MVP.
- Reliability: PASS - DB constraints + transactional consume path; expired/used/invalid tokens rejected with stable codes.
- Maintainability: PASS - Clear layering (HTTP handler → DB service); focused tests exist for key flows.
