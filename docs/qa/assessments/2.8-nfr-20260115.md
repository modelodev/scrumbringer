# NFR Assessment: 2.8

Date: 2026-01-15
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary

- Security: PASS - Auth required + double-submit CSRF on POSTs.
- Performance: CONCERNS - 1s client timer tick scheduled continuously; no explicit perf target defined.
- Reliability: PASS - Server-side cleanup before release/complete; best-effort pause is acceptable.
- Maintainability: CONCERNS - "Now Working" adds significant complexity to `apps/client/src/scrumbringer_client.gleam`.

## Critical Issues

None identified.

## Quick Wins

- Gate timer tick to only run when `active_task` exists.
- Add test coverage for “project change triggers pause” behavior (AC6) to reduce regression risk.
