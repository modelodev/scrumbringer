# Smoke Verification: Story 2.7

Date: 2026-01-14
Runner: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Scope

- Validate Caddy SPA fallback for deep links (server-side routing)
- Validate `/api/v1/*` reverse proxy wiring (Caddy → backend port)

## Tooling

- Caddy config: `Caddyfile.smoke` (HTTP on :8080)
- Mock API server: `scripts/smoke/mock-api-2.7.mjs`
- Runner script: `scripts/smoke-2.7.sh`

## Execution

Command:

- `./scripts/smoke-2.7.sh`

## Results

PASS

### What this validates

- Deep link `/admin/members?project=2` is served via SPA fallback (returns `index.html` containing `scrumbringer_client.js`)
- Reverse proxy wiring works for `/api/v1/*` (request to `/api/v1/auth/me` succeeds through Caddy)

### What this does NOT validate

- Browser-level History API navigation + `popstate` (Back/Forward) end-to-end
  - Covered logically by code review + unit tests, but not exercised in real browser automation in this environment.
