# NFR Assessment: 2.2

Date: 2026-01-14
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary

- Security: PASS (MVP) - Best-effort rate limiting added for token-based endpoints; still recommend logging/alerting.
- Performance: PASS - Simple DB lookups/updates + ETS-based limiter; suitable for MVP.
- Reliability: PASS - Token consumption remains transactional; explicit error codes.
- Maintainability: PASS - Clear separation of server logic and client state machine; tests in place.

## Notes

- Rate limiting depends on client IP headers (`X-Forwarded-For` / `X-Real-Ip`). For production behind a proxy, ensure these headers are set correctly.
