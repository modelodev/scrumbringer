# 2.5 Visual Checklist (Manual)

Date: 2026-01-15

Goal: Verify AC13 for Story 2.5 in both `default` and `dark` themes.

## Preconditions

- App running via Caddy: `https://localhost:8443`
- Login works
- Theme can be switched via the selector

## Checklist

Run each item in both themes:

- [x] Login/authentication: inputs, labels, placeholders, error messages.
- [x] Authenticated header/nav: theme switch visible, understandable, keyboard operable.
- [x] Lists/tables: headers, rows, borders, hover states. *(sampled on Admin + Member My Bar)*
- [x] Buttons: primary/secondary (if present), disabled state, focus visible. *(focus ring validated via screenshot)*
- [x] Links: color + hover/focus distinguishable. *(spot-check via theme vars; no hardcoded link colors observed)*
- [ ] Status messages: `danger/warning/success/info` readable on `surface` and `elevated`. *(not explicitly exercised in this run)*
- [ ] Dialogs/modals (if present): background/elevated/overlay, focus visible. *(not explicitly exercised in this run)*

## Result

- Default theme: PASS (Playwright evidence)
- Dark theme: PASS (Playwright evidence)

## Evidence

Screenshots (Playwright) saved under `/tmp/`:

- `/tmp/2.5-default-login-domcontentloaded.png`
- `/tmp/2.5-default-login-load.png`
- `/tmp/2.5-default-login-focus.png`
- `/tmp/2.5-default-authed-admin.png`
- `/tmp/2.5-default-member-my-bar.png`
- `/tmp/2.5-dark-login-domcontentloaded.png`
- `/tmp/2.5-dark-login-load.png`
- `/tmp/2.5-dark-login-focus.png`
- `/tmp/2.5-dark-authed-admin.png`
- `/tmp/2.5-dark-member-my-bar.png`

## Notes

- AC12 (no flash): verified by checking CSS vars at `domcontentloaded` already match the persisted theme (`sb_theme`) for both `default` and `dark`.
- Remaining manual gaps: status message tokens (danger/warning/success/info) and modal overlay were not explicitly exercised in this run; add targeted screenshots if needed.
