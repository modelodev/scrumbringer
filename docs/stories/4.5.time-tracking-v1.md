# Story 4.5: Time tracking v1 (tiempo dedicado por persona)

## Status: Draft

## Story
**As a** project admin (and as a member),
**I want** basic time tracking on tasks,
**so that** we can understand effort distribution and improve estimates.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Timer semantics**: A user can start/pause their active work on a claimed task; only one active timer per user.
2. **Persistence**: Time spent is stored per user per task.
3. **Admin correction**: Project admin can adjust time manually (audit logged).
4. **Reporting**: A minimal report exists (per project/task).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Define data model for time entries
- [ ] Implement start/pause endpoints
- [ ] Implement admin adjustment endpoint
- [ ] Implement minimal reporting UI

## Dev Notes
⚠️ **Planning stub / example**: This story is not fully refined.

## Testing
- Server: `make test`
- Client: `apps/client: gleam test`
