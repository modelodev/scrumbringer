# Story 4.2: Dashboard de workflows v1 (admin)

## Status: Draft

## Story
**As an** org admin,
**I want** a workflows dashboard,
**so that** I can understand whether rules are helping or hurting flow.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Rules list**: Admin sees all org/project rules with active state.
2. **Metrics per rule**: For each rule, show evaluated/applied/suppressed counts and suppression reasons.
3. **Time window filter**: Admin can filter last 24h / 7d / 30d.
4. **Project filter**: Admin can filter by project.
5. **No user ranking**: The dashboard focuses on rule behavior; no leaderboards.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Extend metrics queries to support time windows
- [ ] Implement admin UI dashboard view
- [ ] Add drill-down to last N events for a rule (for debugging)

## Dev Notes
⚠️ **Planning stub / example**: This story is not fully refined.

- Depends on Sprint 3 engine + metrics events.

## Testing
- Server: `make test`
- Client: `apps/client: gleam test`
